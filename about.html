			<p>I'm currently studying Interdisciplinary Design (Photography and media Studies) at Point Park University.</p>

			<p>I'm just starting out, so I'm trying many types of photography.</p>
			
			<p>I take light painting photos, portraits, pet photos, and still lives.</p>

			<p>I'm graduating in 2021, so if you like my work, feel free to contact me or follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/Sketchyjpeg/">Instagram</a>.</p>
